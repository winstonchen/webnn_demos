### How to Generate Face Landmark Detection TFLite Model

Check out [yinguobing/cnn-facial-landmark](https://github.com/yinguobing/cnn-facial-landmark) for more details about this model.

This model is converted from a pre-trained [Simple CNN](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Nvzu5A9CjP70sDhiRbMzuIwFLnrq2Qpw/view?usp=sharing) model. You can use the following commands to convert your own model.

```
tflite_convert \
--output_file=${out_dir}/face_landmark.tflite \
--graph_def_file=${download_model_dir}/SimpleCNN.pb \
--input_arrays=input_to_float \
--output_arrays=logits/BiasAdd
```
